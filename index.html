        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Sanghar Pen, and I was a journalist in Cambodia for 12 years. I moved to the United States couple of years ago. <br>
            However, for many reasons, I want to create a personal website to post my opinion articles based on my observations. <br>
            I hope that I can share my views in a positive way with the Cambodian viewers.
